	    I believe that therapy can help you get more out of life.  We will work together to improve relationships and deal with depression, anxiety, trauma, work performance, and life transitions. Therapy's healing power is based in candid dialogue between a patient and an experienced, professional therapist; this dialogue enables you to gain a clearer understanding of <em>who</em> you are and <em>how</em> you are in the world. This understanding will help you in your day-to-day life.</p>

		<p class="article">
		Perhaps you will be uncomfortable or in emotional pain when we first meet. For this reason, a solid therapist-patient relationship is essential, and I will found our relationship on mutual trust, respect, and the shared goal of discovery and healing. This allows me to better know you and offer my best, given your particular circumstances. </p>
